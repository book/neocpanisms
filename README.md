Generates lists for the "Create a new CPAN dist per month" contest.

# TODO

This was a lashup following an offhand comment from BOOK.
Things to do:

* See whether POSIX::strftime() would be quicker than DateTime. I reckon so.
* Highlight people who are safe in the current period
* In all-time lists, highlight chains which are still active
